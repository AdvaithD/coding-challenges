# Aerolab Coding Challenge 2

We built a small React app containing a reference design in SVG and some HTML. Everything works except for the CSS, which we seem to have lost.
Your challenge is to edit **./src/User.scss** to make both designs match as closely as you can, using all the tools in your CSS arsenal. We'll be evaluating both the design and code quality.
We've provided a compare button to compare your implementation with the design. There's also a progress bar in the *Join Us* button, which runs a visual comparison to the original design every few seconds and tells you how far you are from a perfect implementation. Good luck!
