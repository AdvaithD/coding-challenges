# Aerolab Coding Challenge 2

You'll need the latest [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/) for this challenge.

Once it's installed, you need to open a command line on this exact directory and type

`npm install`

And to run the coding challenge in a local server with live reload, type

`npm start`

Go ahead and set up your environment, I'll wait.

All done? Awesome, let's get to it.


## The challenge

We built a small React app containing a reference design in SVG and some HTML. Everything works except for the CSS, which we seem to have lost.

Your challenge is to edit **./src/User.scss** to make both designs match as closely as you can, using all the tools in your CSS arsenal. We'll be evaluating both the design and code quality.

We've provided a compare button to compare your implementation with the design. There's also a progress bar in the *Join Us* button, which runs a visual comparison to the original design every few seconds and tells you how far you are from a perfect implementation. Good luck!
